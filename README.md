# SoftwareDevelopmentLifecycle
A description of what I've learned from the course CS 250 (Software Development Lifecycle)


Q: How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating"user stories'' help with this?
A: I interpet user needs and implement them into our program by asking open-ended questions to the user. I want the user to freely explain and expand on what they desire from a product. I will sometimes ask for more clarity, but for the most part, I want to make sure I'm collecting all the information from the user. To implement this, I want to create test cases and user stories. I want to base the importance of each task based on complexity and general usefulness to our end product. Creating User Stories helps us detail what user's desire and its importance in an easy to understand format.

Q: How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
A: I want to approach development in increments. I want to test often and have as much working code as I can. This is the agile process I want to incorporate the most. Before, I've typed out a great amount of code, only to find bugs that happened very early on in my process. With an Agile approach, I should catch bugs early and often.

Q: What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
A: What it means to be a good team member in software development is communication. The ability to communicate your needs, tasks, and impediments to your team members allows for the fluidity needed to create a good work space that creates an excellent product.
